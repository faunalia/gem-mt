GEM Modellers Toolkit (GEM-MT) is a EXPERIMENTAL plugin for QuantumGIS.
GEM-MT aims to analyse and process earthquake catalogue data.


How to use the plugin:
- install and activate the plugin
- open Plugins->GEM-MT->Settings dialog and set CSV delimiter and fields' names 
(not needed if you're using the sample data shipped with the plugin)
- press the "Load CVS file" on the plugins bar and load the CSV file (or go to 
the plugin folder and load the "earthquakes.csv" file in the data directory)
- activate the "Plot statistics" panel to be able to plot statistics of the 
data on the whole data set or subsets defined by user drawn polygons or by 
filtering the variables (see "Plot panel" section below)
- or activate the "Classification" panel to start data classification (see 
"Classification panel" section below).

Plot panel:
- to filter the data will be plotted just use the sliders in the panel and/or
define an area by pressing the "Draw" button and then drawing a polygon
- select one of the plot types, then X,Y fields, add a title and press the 
"Plot" button to see the result
- save the figure using buttons on the toolbar.

Classification panel:
- delineate the Area of Interest defined by a user drawn polygon
- press the "New" button to define buffer areas drawing a segment on the map 
which is the midline of the area and then updating the buffer width to 
shrink/grow the buffer around the midline (buffer width unit depends on the map 
Coordinate Reference System unit)
- click on the "Open cross section" button to project all data that within the 
selected buffer area onto the vertical plane defined by the buffer midline, 
they will be plotted in a Distance/Depth cross section (see "Cross section 
dialog" section below)
- after doing the previous steps for each buffer area you want to define 
click on the "Display classified earthquakes" button to see the result loaded 
on the map.

Cross section dialog:
- the cross section display data within a buffer area plotted in a 
- press the "Draw horizontal line" button from the cross section toolbar to
draw a line to separate out the shallow earthquakes above this line from the 
deeper ones below it
- press the "Draw oblique line" button from the cross section toolbar to draw
a line inclined from upper left to lower right, that line will define a third 
group of indeterminate earthquakes between the inclined and horizontal lines
